The build uses a very old Makefile, but appears to still work.

First, edit the top of Makefile for where the executables should be
installed.  Next, change LDFLAGS and CFLAGS so that libsndfile
libraries can be found.

Call:

> make depend

This will rewrite Makefile with the new dependencies.

> make

Builds the executables.

> sudo make install

Copies executables to BINDIR


Note that by default, iaexpr is not made because it depends on
a little-used library called libeval. See comments in iaexpr.cc.
