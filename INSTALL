First, edit the top of Makefile for where the executables should be installed.
Next, change LDFLAGS and CFLAGS so that libsndfile and the boost libraries can
be found.

Call:

> make depend

This will rewrite Makefile with the new dependencies.

> make

Builds the executables.

> make install

Copies executables to BINDIR
