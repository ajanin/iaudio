These are a series of utilities that use libsndfile,
an open source audio processing library available at
http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile.

See INSTALL for installation instructions.
See LICENSE for licensing terms.

iaamp   - Apply an exponential power to every sample in an audio file.
iableep - Add "bleep" sounds to an audio file.
iachop 	- Divide up audio files into multiple new audio files.
iadiff  - Show differences between audio files.
iaexpr  - Apply an arbitrary function to every sample in an audio file.
iainfo  - Get header information such as duration, sample rate, etc.
iajoin 	- Combine audio file excerpts into a new audio file
iamix   - Volume equalize and mix audio files
iastat 	- Compute statistics on audio (e.g. min, max, stddev)

iaconvert - A python script that tries to convert any audio file
to a standard format. Requires a bunch of other programs to work.
I wouldn't bother with this if I were you -- it's really just for
my own use.

INSTALLING

Sorry, but I only have a (very old) Makefile. If libsndfile is installed
in a standard location, the following should work:

make depend
make
sudo make install

Note that by default, iaexpr is not made because it depends on
a little-used library called libeval. See comments in iaexpr.cc.
