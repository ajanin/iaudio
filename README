These are a series of utilities that use libsndfile,
an open source audio processing library available at
http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile or through your
favorite package manager (e.g. apt-get install libsndfile1-dev).

See INSTALL for installation instructions.
See LICENSE for licensing terms.
